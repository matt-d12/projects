        Hi everyone, my name is Matthew D'Angina. 
        I am working towards a degree in software development and currently work in IT for a manufacturing company doing a bit of everything from networking, working with packing robots, to connecting a basic printer.
        I love playing sports (mainly volleyball), board/card/video games with friends, watching movies and working on random game dev projects in my free time.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was born in the church and recently have been studying a lot on eternal marriage as my fiance and I prepare for our wedding in mid-March.
        As I have been studying, a quote has stuck with me about communication from a talk by Elder Marvin J. Ashton called Family Communication that says, "How important is it to know how to disagree with another's point of view without being disagreeable."
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm very excited to learn about web development and get some first-hand experience with HTML and CSS.
