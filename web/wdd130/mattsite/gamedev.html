                    Game Desgin has always been one of my favorite hobbies that I wish I could turn into a job someday. For now though, it is one of the best ways I can express myself creatively as I lack heavy writing or art skills.
                    In this brief showcase you will see a few of my completed projects. From the first game I ever created called "rocks in space" that is a bare-bones spin-off of Asteroids, to a current project I am even working on now where one simple guy gets lost in a forest and has to fight for survival. <br>
                    While most of my knowledge from game design has been self taught form the internet, I remember taking a game development class in high school. Between that and my software development education, learning new techniques and ways to develop games has gone hand in hand even when using other languages.
