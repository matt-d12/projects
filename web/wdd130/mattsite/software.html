                        While I cannot claim this project as completely my own, having worked with multiple coworkers on this was the best way I could have accomplished this. Hearing different ideas especially during the planning phase when we were trying to figure out what are we even trying to accomplish with this, really made me appreciate feedback and various perspectives.
                        This program simply starts out by creating a small dialog box in which the installer (usually a member of IT) goes through and depending on the users role and what kind of device it is, simply goes through a check box of what is needed. The program then takes into account those selected boxes and begins working through tailormade installs for that device.
                        The main goal for this was to be a one time, set it and forget it so we didn't have to keep coming back to it and automate the entire process, including multiple reboots during the setup cycle. <br>
