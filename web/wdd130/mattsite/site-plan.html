        <b>Overview</b><br>
        Hi there! My name is Matt D'Angina and this is a small webpage to showcase some projects and work I have done in both the realm of software develpment as well as game design. These projects range from corporate scripting for company app installtions, to simple Python programs, to 2D pixel games and many things inbetween.
        The work and things shown here are both from a professional/educational background as well as some passion projects or self-taught ideas and solutions.

      <h3>Software Development</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Overview</b><br>
        I have recently switched to learning more in-depth about software development as this has really grabbed my interest over the past few years in the workforce. Figuring out how to optimize workflows and also to automate processes (especially the mundane and repetitive ones), has been very exciting for me to learn about and put into practice. 
        One of those processes has to be the creation of an auto-install scripts that combines powershell commands as well as various updates/pulls from our company resources. <br>
        <b>Auto-Install Showcase</b><br>
        While I cannot claim this project as completely my own, having worked with multiple coworkers on this was the best way I could have accomplished this. Hearing different ideas especially during the planning phase when we were trying to figure out what are we even trying to accomplish with this, really made me appreciate feedback and various perspectives.
        This program simply starts out by creating a small dialog box in which the installer (usually a member of IT) goes through and depending on the users role and what kind of device it is, simply goes through a check box of what is needed. The program then takes into account those selected boxes and begins working through tailormade installs for that device.
        The main goal for this was to be a one time, set it and forget it so we didn't have to keep coming back to it and automate the entire process, including multiple reboots during the setup cycle. <br>

      <h3>Game Design</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Games History and Showcase</b><br>
        Game Desgin has always been one of my favorite hobbies that I wish I could turn into a job someday. For now though, it is one of the best ways I can express myself creatively as I lack heavy writing or art skills.
        In this brief showcase you will see a few of my completed projects. From the first game I ever created called "rocks in space" that is a bare-bones spin-off of Asteroids, to a current project I am even working on now where one simple guy gets lost in a forest and has to fight for survival. <br>
        While most of my knowledge from game design has been self taught form the internet, I remember taking a game development class in high school. Between that and my software development education, learning new techniques and ways to develop games has gone hand in hand even when using other languages.
