            <p>Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that 
                by small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in 
                many instances doth confound the wise.</p>

            <p>O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to 
                bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it; 
                that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, 
                O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of 
                thy Son, and always remember him, and keep his commandments which he hath given 
                them, that they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Amen.</p>
